The data preparation files in this directory aggregate and average the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) from the NOAA.

The objective with the [Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00516) dataset was to create a dataset where each entry is a year-state pair that describes average meteorological stats for that state in that year. The process to aggregate a larger dataset using the GSOD was as follows. We download the GSOD dataset using download_gsod.sh. It creates a set of folders where each folder corresponds to each year from 1980 to 2021. Each folder contains a csv file for a weather station in some state. The csv file contains the station's daily meteorological info for that station in that year. With a python script, we iterate over every weather-station-csv file in the year's folder to figure out the state of that weather station, and add its entries to a dictionary storing the entries for each state of that year. Then, we take the averages of the values for each state of that year and save them as a single year-state dataset entry.

After iterating over every year, we save the year-state dataset entries into a csv file. After the GSOD data was processed, it was combined with the original dataset with Excel VLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH functions to match state/year pair rows. Originally missing temperature data was backfilled using the new GSOD data. The python and bash scripts
